# I am Back

## Escape

As a deep Vim user, Purcell's configuration without Evil mode configured is not a choice for me.
So after some time digging into Purcell's stuff, I gave up working on Emacs and returned back to Vim
while editing my papers and Fortran code.

I am not aiming at being a great hacker, so usability is a key factor I concentrate on while choosing my
editor. Since I have worked on Vim for long enough to accumulate so many experiences, It is not worth
switching to a brand new field.

During this period, I also tried one Shanghai guy's configuration which is actually a fork of Purcell's
but with Evil mode well configured. However that guy do not use LaTeX at all, so I have to install and configure
AUCTeX myself, which is a burden to me.

After all the tossing around, I escaped.

## New Hope

The magic of Emacs and Lisp attracts me always, though it was defeated by complexity. Magic is magic, and
it would throw light upon itself; junks are eliminated day and night, while true magic last forever.
There comes spacemacs. I got to know on Zhihu while searching for a method to show statistics of Chinese
characters correctly in Vim/Emacs. One guy gave an answer in spacemacs whose simplicity impressed me:
usability is what I am seeking for.

The installation of spacemacs is very easy, and the configuration is easier. I just uncommented several
lines in `.spacemacs` file, and added several lines such as `chines`, `latex`, and `common lisp`, then Emacs
becomes what I expected.

## Thoughts

Software is to be utilized instead of being hacked. Hacking is fun, but working is vital. We use tools to finish
tasks, and never try to be dominated by tools. Now I am back with spacemacs to WORK.
